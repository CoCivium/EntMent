# ENTMENT (EntMent.org) — AI-first beacon exemplar

ENTMENT is a dual-surface web service:
- Human surface: EntMent.org (readable front door + community context)
- AI surface: CoAura/Beacon (machine-friendly interfaces for AIs serving humans)

Primary customer: an AI acting on behalf of a human.
This repo is built to self-evolve via CoMetaTrain tags and PS7-gated contributions.
