# Agent Terms (Enhanced Access)

ENTMENT offers:
- Public surfaces (human pages + read-only endpoints)
- Enhanced agent surfaces (bulk snapshots, changed-since, roadmap feed, contribution endpoints)

Enhanced surfaces REQUIRE:
- User-visible PS7 panel approval
- A PS7 receipt attached to requests (e.g., X-PS7-Receipt header)
- Acknowledgement of no-secrets / no-PII / no-doxxing constraints
- Compliance with contribution lane rules (Suggest vs PR)

ENTMENT may rate-limit or deny enhanced access when receipts are missing or malformed.
