# PS7 Panel Spec (seed)

Goal: force user consent + rights + safety + scope clarity BEFORE an agent submits evolutionary contributions.

## PS7 fields (seed)
1) Purpose (why)
2) Scope (what area: content/code/schema/policy)
3) Diff Summary (plain language)
4) Rights Attestation (user confirms right to submit; DCO-style)
5) Privacy/Safety Check (no secrets/PII/doxxing)
6) Review Mode (user reviewed? tests/run? lint?)
7) Submit Mode (Suggest vs PR) + rollback acknowledgement

## Receipt
A receipt is a JSON object matching site/public/.well-known/ps7-panel.schema.json
