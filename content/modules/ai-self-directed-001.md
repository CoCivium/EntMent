## Objective
Learn a repeatable loop for using AI to learn faster without fooling yourself.

## The Loop
1. Define a question + success criteria.
2. Ask for a plan + risks + unknowns.
3. Produce an artifact (notes, spec, draft, code).
4. Red-team the artifact (contradictions, missing evidence, weak assumptions).
5. Iterate once.
6. Publish + invite critique.

## Prompts
- "Help me define success criteria for: <topic>. Give 3 measurable signals."
- "Red-team this plan. Find contradictions and missing premises."
- "Turn the improved plan into a checklist I can follow."

## Output
Post: (a) your success criteria, (b) the first artifact, (c) the red-team findings, (d) what you changed.
