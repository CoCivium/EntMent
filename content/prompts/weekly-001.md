## Prompt
Write a short list of tasks you *do not* want your AI to do for you, even if it technically can.

## Why
Agentic delegation is powerful and risky. Your boundaries are part of your operating system.

## Template
- "My AI should never: …"
- "My AI can do with confirmation: …"
- "My AI can do autonomously: …"
