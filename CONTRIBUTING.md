# Contributing to ENTMENT

## Two lanes
1) Suggest lane (preferred): open an Issue with a PS7 receipt + proposed patch/diff.
2) PR lane: PRs are allowed only when PS7 receipt indicates user review + rights attestation.

## Required: PS7 receipt
All contributions must include a PS7 receipt object (see docs/PS7_PANEL_SPEC.md).
For PRs, include it in the PR description and in docs/receipts/ as a file.

## AI-assisted addendum (seed)
If any part was AI-assisted:
- The human user confirms they reviewed the change.
- The human user confirms they have the rights to contribute the material.
- The submission must not include secrets/PII or non-consensual personal data.

## Conduct
Be constructive. No solicitation. No doxxing. No spam.
